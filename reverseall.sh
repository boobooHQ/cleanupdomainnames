If the list is stored in a file, with one word per line, you can use the following script to reverse the positions of all the letters in each word:


#!/bin/bash

# Read the list from the file
while read -r element
do
    # Reverse the element and print it
    echo "$(echo "$element" | rev)"
done < "$1"


To use this script, save it to a file and make it executable with the chmod command. Then, you can run it and pass the name of the file as an argument. For example:

>>  ./reverse-list.sh list.txt


This will read the list from list.txt, reverse the positions of all the letters in each word, and print the result to the terminal.
