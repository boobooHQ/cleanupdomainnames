GET THE REVERSED LIST 

THEN SAVE THE BELOW BASH SCRIPT IN cleanup.sh

chmod it 

and run with input.txt containing the reveresed domain list with numbers at front .

#!/bin/bash

# read the input from stdin
while read line; do
  # remove the leading characters before the first period (.)
  output=$(echo "$line" | sed 's/^[^.]*//')
  # print the modified line
  echo "$output"
done

To use this script, you can save it to a file (e.g. "cleanup.sh") and then run it like this:


bash cleanup.sh < input.txt > output.txt
